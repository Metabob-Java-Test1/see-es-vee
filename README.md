# see-es-vee
A high efficiency CSV parsing library for Java 9 and above

see-es-vee is a Java library that can be used to convert CSV Files into their Java Object representation. It can also be used to convert a Java Obects to an equivalent CSV file. see-es-vee can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.

There are a few open-source projects that can convert CSV Files to Java Objects. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. cee-es-vee considers both of these as very important design goals.
